# Faultybot

## Technical fundamentals
To use the bot you need a Discord bot and a Lichess account.
We recommend creating another new account for this purpose. The account is only important if you want to kick people. Otherwise you don't need a Lichess account.  The presence of Python is required.

### Create a Discord bot
Lichess bots can be created on the [Discord Developer](https://discord.com/developers/) page. Since this is a different topic, we recommend the video from freeCodeCamp. It is linked at the end of this text. Of course, the bot must also be invited to their server and be able to write there. But this is your responsibility.
